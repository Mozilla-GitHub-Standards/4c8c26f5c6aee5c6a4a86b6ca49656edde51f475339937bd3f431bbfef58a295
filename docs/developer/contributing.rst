Contributing
============

GitHub
------

Please use the `GitHub project page`_ to report bugs, issues
and feature requests.

And don't be afraid to express yourself. If something isn't clear or you
don't understand something perhaps the documentation or the configuration
or some parameter is not easy enough to understand.

But please try to avoid using GitHub issues to ask questions specific
to your installation. If you need help, the best place to go is to use IRC
and the ``#breakpad`` room on ``irc.mozilla.org``.

When reporting bugs, please try to include as much information as you
possibly can. Don't forget to include exactly what versions you have
of ``crontabber``, ``configman``, Python and PostgreSQL.
But before you share your config files, please please please
make sure they don't contain any passwords or any other secrets that could
put your system at risk.


Coding style
------------

We try to stick to a strict PEP8 guideline with lines no longer than 79
characters. But functionality is more important than form.
If you have some code to contribute don't feel intimidated that your code
isn't perfect. We can always change it later.

But please try to continue the existing patterns. If the code around uses
``'`` instead of ``"`` then continue to use ``'``. Consistency makes
the code easier to read and debug.
