crontabber
==========

``crontabber`` is a cron job manager.

Killer features include:

* Retries jobs on failure automatically
* Dependency-aware, and wonâ€™t execute child jobs that depend on parents that
  have failed
* Nagios integration including support for WARNINGs and CRITICALs, and
  configurable escalation from WARNING to CRITICAL
  (e.g. 3 WARNINGS == CRITICAL).

You start crontabber with crontab and internally it figures out which jobs
to run when and in what ideal order.

crontabber requires python 2.6 or python 2.6 and PostgreSQL 9.2 or greater.
